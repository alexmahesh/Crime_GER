The Dashboard shows different statistics and gives insights about juvenile crime in Germany.

### The Data

The Data used for this Dashboard comes from:  
- [German Federal Criminal Police Office: PKS Bundeskriminalamt, 2018 - 2022, Version 2.0](https://www.bka.de/DE/AktuelleInformationen/StatistikenLagebilder/PolizeilicheKriminalstatistik/pks_node.html)

The Dashboard is coded completely in Python with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). It is hosted with a free account  on the Streamlit-Server.  

__Database__  
It loads the needed data from several tables stored in a PostgreSQL-Database hosted on [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/de-de/).
